###  Difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull

#### Git Fetch
- It only downloads the changes from the remote repository.  
- It will not update or modify your working branch.  
- Mainly used when you want to review the changes before merging them.  

#### Git Pull
- It actually downloads and merges the changes into your current branch.  
- Useful when you are ready to update your branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.  

### Git Merge Conflict

A merge conflict arises when two or more people try to change the same line of code in a file.  

I can solve it by:  
1. Opening the file.  
2. Removing the conflict markers
3. Deciding which line of code should remain (or by combining both lines).  
4. Committing the changes.  
5. Finally, the merge conflict is cleared.
