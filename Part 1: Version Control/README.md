###  Difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull

#### Git Fetch
- It only downloads the changes from the remote repository.  
- It will not update or modify your working branch.  
- Mainly used when you want to review the changes before merging them.  

#### Git Pull
- It actually downloads and merges the changes into your current branch.  
- Useful when you are ready to update your branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
