         Completed writing Dockerfile for dummy Python application in this folder **dummy-python-application**

 # The difference between Dockerfile, Docker image, and Docker container.

## Dockerfile  
A file that contains instructions to build a Docker image.  

## Docker Image  
It is like a template created from the Dockerfile which contains the code and dependencies required for the application.  

## Docker Container  
It is a running instance of the Docker Image where you can run your application.  


# How you would reduce the image size if your first build is too large.

- By using  multi-stage Docker builds , we can reduce the size of the image.  
### 3.
## Run your application container locally and show it working (screenshots/logs are fine).
